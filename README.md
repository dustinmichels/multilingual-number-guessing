# number-guessers

In this repository, I am aspiring to accrue a simple, idiomatic number guessing game in as many programming languages as possible. Feel free to submit improvements and additions!

## Guidelines ##

A program shoud...

1. Randomly select a number between 1 and 100, and let the user guess numbers until the correct one is found.
2. Include some kind of defense against bad user input, if possible.
3. Provide some feedback along the lines of "higher...", "lower...", and "You got it!"
4. Be succinct yet readable, adhering to the adage often attribtued to Albert Einstein to "make things as simple as possible, but not simpler."
5. Be idiomaic, leveraging the particular features and styles of the chosen language.
