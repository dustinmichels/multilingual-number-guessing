# number-guessers

In this repository, I am aspiring to accrue a simple, idiomatic number guessing game in
as many programming languages as possible. Feel free to submit improvements and additions!

## Guidelines ##

A program should...

1. Randomly select an integer between 1 and 100, and repeatedly prompt the user
to make guesses until the correct number is reached.
2. Provide feedback along the lines of "higher...", "lower...", and "You got it!"
3. Report back the total number of guesses it took to reach the right number.
4. Include some kind of defense against bad user input, if possible.
5. Be succinct yet readable. Very readable. Ideally, even illustrative and enlightening!
(Think: "As simple as possible, but not simpler.")
6. Be idiomatic, leveraging the particular features and styles of the chosen language.
