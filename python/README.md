[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a free, open source programming language, popular for uses ranging from

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python is:
- High level & general purpose
- Dynamically typed
- Interpreted (rather than compiled)
- Supportive of multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative, functional, and procedural
