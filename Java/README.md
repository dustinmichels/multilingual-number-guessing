Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Java applications must be
compiled to byte code before they can be run, but after compiling, Java code can be run
on any Java Virutal Machine, regardless of computer architecture, which is neat I guess.

Originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, Java is:

- Statically typed
- Class-based
- Compiled (rather than interpreted)
- Architecture-neutral and portable
